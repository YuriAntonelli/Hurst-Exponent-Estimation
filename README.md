# Efficient Market Hypothesis Testing through Hurst Exponent Estimation
Here, we present a practical demonstration of estimating the Hurst Exponent by leveraging financial time series data. Furthermore, we provide a concise introduction on the fundamental principles of self-similarity and the Hurst Exponent itself.

Our ultimate objective is to delve into the assessment of whether the conditions stipulated by the **Efficient Market Hypothesis** hold true across various market conditions. 
Our findings indicate that discussions about an efficient market are warranted in the **long run**; however, this assertion does not hold when considering shorter time frames. Notably, our analysis incorporates the period of the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
