# Efficient Market Hypothesis Testing through Hurst Exponent Estimation
Here, we present a practical demonstration of estimating the Hurst Exponent by leveraging financial time series data. Furthermore, we provide a concise introduction on the fundamental principles of self-similarity and the Hurst Exponent itself.

Our ultimate objective is to delve into the assessment of whether the conditions stipulated by the Efficient Market Hypothesis hold true across various market conditions.
